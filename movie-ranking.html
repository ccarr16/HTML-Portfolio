<h1>The Best Movies According to Chris</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Mask</h3>
<p>I love how this movie represents a different side to us that we all have</p>
<h3>Yes Man</h3>
<p>Really cool idea of how saying yes to everything can be exciting but how crazy the world can be in its own way.</p>
<h3>Bruce Almighty</h3>
<p>A cool idea on what it takes to be "GOD"</p>
