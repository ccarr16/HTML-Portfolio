<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>I was born and raised in the U.S.A. in a town 50miles from San Francisco. I have lived throught the Bay Area as we call it, and have explored many areas throughout my life. </p>

<p>I have had jobs since Sophmore year in highschool 2012, and have since been jumping from job to job searching for the highest pay that required nothing more than customer service experience and a highschool diploma. I have tried attending Community College but never felt like it was a fit for me. More importantly I wanted to be rich, and soon discovered the best way to be rich and wealthy is to be an Entrepreneur. Fast forward to 2023, 9 YEARS after highschool graduation, I have decided to follow my dream. To quit my 9-5 JOB, and travel the world full time. </p>

<p>In May of 2023, I did the unimaginable, and quit my job, FREEDOM atlast, I moved to Bali, Indonesia, and met absolute paradise. Waiting for me all along was everything I could have ever dreamed of, my journey  has just begun, 6months in Bali later... I still have not made much income as an Entrepreneur but I did come to know myself alot more, My dreams got clearer and bigger, My visions are clearer and brighter. I am now in Istanbul working on my e-commerce to continue making money as an entrepreneur finally, To grow it into a business, and the best part is, I'm finally learning again. Learning to fail, learning to succeed, learning to work hard, learning that life is not easy but everything is possible, learning to follow your dreams no matter what, learning to code, and web design, learning chinese and jiu jitsu, learning how to greet people in new languages I've never thought i'd be speaking in. Learning new food and countries i've never heard of before.... I'm learning what it truly means to be human in a world filled with unknowns  and beautiful adventures. Welcome to my journey, it is just only beginning.. 2/25/2024 11:11pm.</p>
